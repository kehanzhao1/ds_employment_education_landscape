Clicking the above link will take you to the interactive scrolly telling style visualization for this project. The scrollyteller starts with a series of graphs interwoven with textual annotations which will walk you through the state of the data science job market, how it has changed over time, what skills are currently desired, and what responsibilities professional data scientists are tasked with as you scroll down the page. Continue scrolling to see maps and bar charts informing you how and where two-year colleges are attempting to grow data science programs. Our scrolly teller finally ends comparing and contrasting how the skills taught at the community college level contrast to those listed in job descriptions for data science. Our visualization is best viewed full screen 100%.
